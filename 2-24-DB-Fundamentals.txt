Ordinality: Min. number of associations 0 or 1 
Cardinality: Max. number of associations 1 or many

a database is more susceptible to corruption during write/update events
    redundant copies of same info. increases amount of time to perform updates (higher risk of issues and slower response time) 
address through normalization

1st normal form: table must have atomic values (all columns contain single, indivisible values) and no repeating groups or arrays
2nd normal form: contains no partial dependencies 
    solving the issue of redundancy that harm data integrity, performance, and maintainability

-- Before (partial dependency: ProductName depends only on ProductID)
CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
  OrderID   INT,
  ProductID INT,
  Quantity  INT,
  ProductName VARCHAR(200), -- depends only on ProductID (partial dependency)
  PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID)
);

-- After (normalized: move product attributes out)
CREATE TABLE OrderItems (
  OrderID   INT,
  ProductID INT,
  Quantity  INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (OrderID, ProductID),
  FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);

CREATE TABLE Products (
  ProductID   INT PRIMARY KEY,
  ProductName VARCHAR(200),
  Price       DECIMAL(10,2)
);

denormalized data is controlled redundancy which is better for read-heavy workloads like analytics and AI allowing for faster
data retrieval, news feeds, caching, indexing
